                <br>
                <p>It’s easy to see why Corgis are one of the most popular breeds today.
                They’re compact logs of fur with hearts of gold. What more is there to love? 
                We’ve rustled up ten pup-tacular facts about these guys that will surely put a smile on your face.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Corgis were prized in early Welsh settlements for their loyalty, herding abilities, and companionship.
                    Laws were put in place which severely penalized thieves of the much revered pooch,
                    and no family could walk with heads held high if their Corgi wasn’t adept at performing a variety of tricks.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Corgi name originated from the Welshmen who developed the breed and called them “dwarf dog” due to their stature.
                    In Welsh, “cor” means dwarf and “gi” means dog.</li>
                    <li>While Corgis make great house pets, they are known to get heavy if they aren’t regularly exercised.</li>
                    <li>While they make look different in stature, Corgis are closely related to Siberian Huskies. They are both in the Spitz family of dogs,
                    characterized by their thick fur and pointed ears and muzzle.</li>
                    <li> Don’t get confused by their stocky build! Corgis are one of the most athletic breeds, as they were originally herders. 
                    They’ve been known to be shockingly fast runners.</li>
                    <li>Sutter Brown, an adorable Pembroke, was named California’s First Dog in 2010 after his hooman, Jerry Brown, was elected governor.</li>
                    <li>Corgis evolved into two types, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, which weren’t recognized as separate breeds until the 1930s.</li>
                    <li>Beloved in England, Corgis have been part of the British Royal Family for over 70 years. 
                     Queen Elizabeth II has owned more than 30 Corgis since she was a young child, making the breed synonymous with the Royal Family.</li>
                     <li>Coming in at just a foot tall, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the smallest of the herding breeds.</li>
                     <li>Corgis are the 11th smartest dog breed as ranked by psychology professor Stanley Coren.
                     They are able to learn commands in 5-10 repetitions and 85% of the time they obey the command the first time.</li>
